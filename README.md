# Halluncinated Reference Checker

This algorithm is intended to take references from an academic essay or a public research paper and check using Scopus if these references exist and are accurate or if they are ‘hallucinated’ – where references are AI generated and inaccurate due to generative AI’s or LLMs lack of ability to process requests like this.

The algorithm has been completed to a basic level, with areas of improvement in regards to the data it can handle and process including improving accuracy, and additional verification of references.
